I play the violin and I am part of the Caltech Chamber Music program.

In my spare time, I also play chess and was part of a Caltech team at the Collegiate Chess League. Some chess books I enjoy:
<ul class="a">
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smerdons-Scandinavian-David-Smerdon/dp/1781942943">Smerdon's Scandinavian</a>: Scandinavian is an openning that I started playing when I was little. This book presents very novel ideas on how to play it which often lead to chaotic and fun games. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Memorable-Games-Bobby-Fischer/dp/190638830X">My 60 Memorable Games</a>: From the great Bobby Fischer, this collection of games are great for understanding the thought process of a world champion.</li>
