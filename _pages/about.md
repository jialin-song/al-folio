I am a PhD student at Caltech advised by Professor [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php){:target="\_blank"}.\\
I graduated with a bachelor's degree majoring in computer science and mathematics from University of Toronto where I worked with Professor [Michael Brudno](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/public/){:target="\_blank"}, Professor [Faith Ellen](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith/){:target="\_blank"} and Professor [Kumar Murty](http://murty.math.toronto.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interest is to apply policy learning (reinforcement/imitation learning) techniques to solve optimization problems from combinatorial and Bayesian domains.
